## Bezos' leadership

- Extreme calm: 
> "I have never seen anyone so calm in the eye of a storm. Ice water runs through his veins,"
- Long-term focus and unconventional thinking
- Ambition: 
> What is amazing to me is that he is bound only by the laws of physics. He canâ€™t change those. Everything else he views as open to discussion.

## Business strategy

- Turning commoditised business areas (e.g distribution) into core competencies, then later spinning out these core competencies (AWS, distribution network).
- Profitability attracts competition: low margins allows you to reach huge scale with less competition
